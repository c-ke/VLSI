VLSI - Model created for the 32nd VLSI conference in New Delhi 2019.

Hello Everyone!

The files of this repository contains the dataset and the jupyter notebook of the model.
The dataset was extracted over from UCL datasets.
The model I trained has an average accuracy of 76 %.
The major drawback here in this project is the lack of data. Since this model will be deployed real time for live prediction
we expect to have a lot more data collected by that time.

This is an ongoing project, my next step is to create a nn for the data.

//// Next step is to signify proper categoriccal values as 0 is also a class, hence probably remove 0 from classes and use 
natural numbers, for one hot encoding.
